# Overview of Microsoft Graph Data Connect

In a hybrid workplace, organizations must dynamically evolve by implementing a data-driven culture. Today's organizations have an incredible amount of business data across applications and services in Microsoft 365.
 
While the potential this data holds is powerful, organizations must first unlock scale access to their Microsoft 365 data and streamline manual analytical processes to remain competitive.  We live in a world where your data is your competitive advantage. 

To access your Microsoft 365 data in the Microsoft Graph for enterprise analytics, you can use [Microsoft Graph Data Connect](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph), a secure, scalable solution that enables you to access relevant Microsoft 365 datasets incuded in Microsoft Fabric, Azure Synapse, and Azure Data Factory. 

Here are some of the enterprise analytics scenarios that are possible: 

![An image that shows some of the enterprise analytics scenarios that are possible.](images/data_connect_msdc_solution.png)

- **Customer relationship analytics.** For commercial business leaders, go beyond traditional customer relationship management (CRM) insights and understand customer interactions and relationships based on communication and collaboration patterns.
- **Business process analytics.** For better operations, see how work really flows through the organization on a day-to-day basis. Pinpoint the manual processes and workflow bottlenecks that should be automated or optimized.
- **Security and compliance analytics.** To secure sensitive data, learn how employees are using and sharing sensitive information. Implement anomaly detection, threat intelligence, audit log analysis, risk management, and legal forensics.
- **People productivity analytics.** For driving transformation, export your [Microsoft Viva](/viva/microsoft-viva-overview) productivity metrics, so you can convert insights into solutions with digital adoption, smart meetings and content, hybrid workplaces, and cultural change.


## Breadth and depth of Microsoft 365 data

In the following diagram, you can see various types of Microsoft 365 data that organizations get though Microsoft Graph Data Connect. There are datasets available from a wide variety of Microsoft 365 sources, including Azure Active Directory, Outlook, Teams, SharePoint, Viva Insight, and Microsoft Groups—and the list is growing.

Microsoft 365 datasets come ready for analysis. You can have data delivered in the following categories:  

- **Basic datasets:** Datasets generated from raw customer created content and inputs from Microsoft 365 applications and services. 
- **Cleaned datasets:** Datasets generated by either normalization and de-duplication from basic datasets. This can also include datasets created from user activity or behavior signals in Microsoft 365.
- **Curated datasets:** Datasets custom generated for a specific use case or analytics scenarios. This can also include datasets from other Microsoft organizations (Viva Insights, SharePoint, and so on) on Microsoft 365 analytics application for their extensibility.

### Who gets value from Microsoft Graph Data Connect?

- **LOB business leaders** need actionable insights from Microsoft 365 data because it helps them make informed decisions regarding their organization. By analyzing data, they can identify patterns and trends including customer relationship analytics, business process analytics, security and compliance analytics, and people productivity analytics.
- **Data engineers** collect, process, and transform Microsoft 365 data from Microsoft Graph Data Connect into a format that is usable by data scientists and analysts. They construct and manage Microsoft 365 data pipelines as data combined across other data sources in Microsoft Fabric, all while ensuring the highest levels of data quality and consistency. 
- **Data scientists** and **data analysts** play a critical role in helping LOB business leaders make sense of their data and use it to drive business decisions. Data analysts identify trends, patterns, and insights. They analyze Microsoft 365 data from Data Connect data and create reports to make informed decisions. They may also be responsible for creating dashboards and visualizations to communicate their findings. Data scientists build highly accurate, predictive models and algorithms based on the petabytes of available Microsoft 365 data from Data Connect. They use machine learning to analyze data and make predictions about future outcomes.
