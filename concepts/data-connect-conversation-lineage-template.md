[Get Started](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/dataconnect-solutions/tree/main/solutions/conversation-lineage)

## Business Summary test 
Use the Conversation Lineage template to gain insights into an organization's communication patterns by analyzing Microsoft 365 data with Microsoft Graph Data Connect (MGDC). 
This template will teach you the key steps and Azure technologies required to build your own MGDC based application. You will extract and process Microsoft 365 data and run analytics on top of it using Azure Synapse Analytics, you will process both historical data and future data daily using Azure Synapse triggers. You will extract sentiment and Natural Language Processing (NLP) entities from conversations using Azure Cognitive Services and will visualize key insights using PowerBI. 

## Key use cases 
- Integrate Microsoft 365 email conversations with CRM or Ticketing information to create a single view with customer sentiment analysis.  
- Leverage the power of conversation patterns to optimize efficient routing. 
- Craft compelling internal email campaigns with proven results.  
- Identify and eliminate bad communication practices
- Measure changes in an organizationâ€™s communication patterns. 
- Reduce redirecting by determining the value each party brings to the chain of the interaction.

- Get a view of the communications sentiment over time.  
- Find the most frequent keywords found in main titles. 
- Get a view of all your emails sent by each department, your top email senders, the total of emails sent, and the count of emails sent externally.
