# Todo Tasks_v0 dataset

## Description

You can use a Task in Outlook to track a user level work item. Users can note its start, due, or actual completion dates, its progress or status, or whether it's recurring or requires reminding. Tasks are organized in [task folders](https://learn.microsoft.com/previous-versions/office/office-365-api/api/version-2.0/complex-types-for-mail-contacts-calendar#TaskFolderResource), which are in turn organized in [task groups](https://learn.microsoft.com/previous-versions/office/office-365-api/api/version-2.0/complex-types-for-mail-contacts-calendar#TaskGroupResource). Each mailbox has a default task folder (with the **Name** property Tasks) and a default task group (**Name** property My Tasks). 

The **Todo Tasks_v0 dataset** allows you to get all the Tasks created by all the users of a tenant that are secured by Azure Active Directory in Office 365. User accounts can be on Office 365 or a Microsoft account (Hotmail.com, Live.com, MSN.com, Outlook.com, and Passport.com.

## Scenarios

-	Analyzing the number of Tasks created by all users and how many of these tasks got completed before the assigned due dates; how many tasks got completed after the assigned due dates.
-	Identifying stale tasks for notifying respective users to complete their tasks before the due date.
-	Identifying users who have incomplete tasks beyond a particular threshold.
-	Identifying tasks assigned to users where the status remains unchanged beyond a particular threshold.

## Questions

- TBD

## Joining with other datasets

-	This dataset can be joined with other user datasets using the unique identifiers to analyze the tasks data and derive behavioral insights. 

## Definitions

-	**Task**: An Outlook item that can track a work item. Users can use a task to track the start, due and actual completion dates and times, its progress or status, whether it's recurring, and requires a reminder.
-	**Task folder**: A folder that contains tasks. In Outlook, the default task group, My Tasks, contains a default task folder, Tasks, for the user's mailbox. Users cannot rename or delete these default task groups and folders, but users can create additional task groups and task folders.
-	**Task group**: A group of folders that contain tasks. In Outlook, there is a default task group, My Tasks, which you cannot rename or delete. However, you can create additional task groups.
